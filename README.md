Echo Delirium

Overview
Echo Delirium is an experimental audio synthesizer that transforms recorded sounds into surreal musical instruments using AI-powered processing. It combines traditional synthesis techniques with neural networks to create evolving, otherworldly soundscapes that blur the line between reality and hallucination.

Recording
Click the "Record" button after filling in the "Name Your Audio" field to record up to 5 seconds of audio. The recording will be automatically processed and added to your sound library. Each recording can be played back using the virtual keyboard interface, which allows for melodic manipulation of the captured sounds.

Keep the microphone close to the sound source for optimal clarity
Avoid background noise for cleaner processing and more focused transformations
Try recording various sources: voices, objects, ambient sounds, machinery, nature
Experiment with different sound durations and intensities
Virtual Keyboard
The virtual keyboard allows you to play your processed sounds melodically. Use your computer keyboard (A-L keys) or click/touch the keys to trigger notes.

Keyboard Controls
White keys: A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K, L
Black keys: W, E, T, Y, U
Settings
Adjust octave range
Control note velocity
Reality Synthesis Controls
Pitch Shifter
Shift: Transposes audio Â±12 semitones
Mix: Blends between original and shifted sound
Use subtle shifts for harmonics, extreme for otherworldly effects
Filter
Frequency: Shapes tone from 20Hz to 20kHz
Resonance: Emphasizes frequencies around cutoff
High resonance creates singing, whistling effects
Distortion
Drive: Controls distortion intensity and harmonics
Mix: Balances clean and distorted signals
Creates everything from warm saturation to harsh noise
Reverb
Decay: Sets reverb tail length (0.1s to 10s)
Mix: Adjusts dry/wet balance
Long decays create infinite, evolving atmospheres
Nightmare Engine
The Nightmare Engine uses advanced neural networks to transform your sounds into terrifying instruments. It analyzes the audio's spectral content and applies multiple layers of AI-driven processing to create evolving, nightmarish textures that blur the line between reality and madness.

Terror
Controls how deeply the AI corrupts the sound.

Low: Unsettling undertones
Medium: Disturbing transformations
High: Complete reality corruption
Madness
Introduces chaotic instability and unpredictability.

Low: Creeping unease
Medium: Reality fractures
High: Complete sonic insanity
Descent
Controls the depth of the nightmare.

Surface: Lingering dread
Depths: Deep horror
Abyss: Infinite terror
Style Influence
The Style Influence system allows you to combine up to three different musical styles using neural style transfer. Each style imparts unique timbral and textural qualities, and multiple styles can be blended together to create complex, evolving soundscapes.

Influence Amount
Controls how strongly the selected styles affect the sound. Higher values create more dramatic stylistic transformations.

Style Blend
Determines the balance between the original sound and the style-processed versions, allowing for subtle mixing of characteristics.

Available Styles
Glitch:
Digital artifacts and circuit-bent chaos
Drone:
Deep resonant harmonics and layering
Vapor:
Time-stretched with heavy chorus
Dark:
Sub-bass drones and ominous tones
Ritual:
Ancient harmonics and mystical frequencies
Noise:
Filtered chaos and static patterns
Spectral:
Crystalline harmonics and shimmer
Ethereal:
Floating atmospheres and ghostly tones
Cosmic:
Interstellar drones and quantum waves
Infernal:
Hellish distortion and demonic tones
Quantum:
Probability waves and superposition
Necro:
Undead harmonics and sepulchral resonance
Advanced Effects
Granular Void
Fragments sound into microscopic particles.

Density: Controls grain cloud thickness
Size: Adjusts individual grain duration
Creates ethereal, ghostly textures
Spectral Warping
Manipulates frequency content over time.

Warp: Bends and stretches frequencies
Shift: Transposes spectral content
Creates metallic and alien timbres
Neural Modulation
AI-driven sound transformation.

Modulation: Neural processing depth
Feedback: Self-modulating resonance
Creates evolving, organic textures
